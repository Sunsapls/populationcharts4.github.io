    <p style="width: 31%; font-style: italic; font-size: 17px;">The world population means the number of people currently living on the planet. It took hundreds of thousands of years for the world population to grow to 1 billion â€“ then in just another 200 years or so, it grew sevenfold. This dramatic growth has been driven largely by increasing numbers of people surviving to reproductive age and has been accompanied by major changes in fertility rates, increasing urbanization and accelerating migration. Study of population and its growth and all such related aspects is important because understanding potential patterns in future population levels is crucial for anticipating and planning for changing age structures, resource and health-care needs, and environmental and economic landscapes. Changing population size and age structure might have profound economic, social, and geopolitical impacts in many countries. Now, here with the help of these charts and visualizations you can identify some such major aspects (density, net change, urbanization etc.) which are affected by population change. </p>
